<!Here we will study how to use tables in html.>
<!First learn which type of tags are used to create a table.>
<!"tr" tag- It creates rows(rows are vertical), in which we write th, which are the actual headings of rows>
<!Then we end the tr tag, then starts it again, now we will put data of those headings, by writing "td" tag>
