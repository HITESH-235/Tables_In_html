<!At first, we will see height, width. they are used to set the length and breadth of the tag>
<!If table is used it will decide the length & breadth of table on screen in px, %(% means if written 100%, it will cover whole screen>
<!but their are too much problems(try different tags with different properties) also said as exceptions>
<!For example, if we use padding, then alignment property will face problem and you wouldn't get required output>
<!And the way they are written must be followed for any property you learned>
<!You can align your tag as you wish using the write name(vertical, text(horizontal actually), left, right>
<!Don't forget to give the right colon at write place or you can't get desired output>
